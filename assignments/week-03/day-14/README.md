Friday 11.12.2020

**Turn in your GitHub repository URLs into Canvas solo or in pairs (please add `kthorri`, `fanneyyy` and `ironpeak` as collaborators)**

Your Client Circle CI Pipeline should be running:
- Lint
- Test
- Build
- Publish
- E2E
- Deploy

Your Server Circle CI Pipeline should be running:
- Lint
- Unit-Test
- Build
- Publish
- Acceptance-Test
- Capacity-Test
- Deploy

They must be placed at these location to get full marks.

Your `infrastructure-repository/README.md` file should include the URL to the instances running:
- The game client `connect4.{{team-name}}.hgopteam.com`
- The game server `connect-four-server-production.{{team-name}}.hgopteam.com`
- Links to your client and server repositories.
- Links to your Sentry organization
- Links to your Circle CI Projects

If you did anything extra, you should list it up in the `infrastructure-repository/README.md` if you
want us to take it into account.
